      "question": "In WordPress, what is the difference between an 'action' and a 'filter'?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Actions modify data, filters trigger events" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Actions execute code at specific points, filters modify data before it's used" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "They are the same thing with different names" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Actions are for the admin, filters are for the front-end" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Actions (do_action/add_action) let you execute custom code at specific points in the WordPress lifecycle. Filters (apply_filters/add_filter) let you modify data as it passes through the system before it's rendered or saved."

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Custom WordPress plugins should directly modify core WordPress files to add functionality.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Never modify core files — updates will overwrite your changes. WordPress provides hooks (actions and filters) specifically for extending functionality without touching core code."

        { "id": "d", "text": "A type of WordPress theme" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Custom Post Types extend WordPress beyond 'Posts' and 'Pages' to handle any content structure — Products, Events, Testimonials, Portfolios, etc. Each gets its own admin interface, URLs, and template hierarchy."
