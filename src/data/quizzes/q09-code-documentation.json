      "id": "q09-q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When is an inline code comment most valuable?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "To describe what every line of code does" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "To explain WHY a non-obvious decision was made" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "To separate sections of code visually" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "To mark code that you wrote versus others" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "The best comments explain 'why' rather than 'what'. Code should be self-documenting for the 'what'. Comments should capture context, business rules, or non-obvious trade-offs that aren't apparent from the code itself."
    },

      "id": "q09-q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which commit message follows the Conventional Commits format?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Fixed the bug" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "fix(auth): resolve token refresh race condition" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Update files" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "WIP changes" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Conventional Commits uses the format 'type(scope): description'. The type indicates the kind of change (feat, fix, docs, refactor), scope indicates the area affected, and the description is imperative and concise."

      "id": "q09-q3",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A pull request description should only contain the ticket number, not a summary of changes.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Good PR descriptions include context (why the change was made), a summary of what changed, testing steps, and screenshots for UI changes. The ticket number provides context but isn't sufficient on its own."

        { "id": "d", "text": "An automated deployment report" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "ADRs document significant technical decisions with their context, options considered, and rationale. They help future team members understand why things were built a certain way."

      "question": "Which is the best indicator that code needs a comment?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "The function is longer than 10 lines" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "You used a clever regex or workaround that someone would need context to understand" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "The variable names are short" },
        { "id": "d", "text": "The code uses a popular library" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "Comments are valuable for non-obvious code: workarounds for browser bugs, complex regex patterns, performance optimizations with trade-offs, or business logic that can't be inferred from the code."
