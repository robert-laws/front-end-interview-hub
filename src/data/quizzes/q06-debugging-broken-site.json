      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Rolling back to the previous working version should always be the first action when a deployment breaks.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "While rollback is sometimes necessary (especially for critical production issues), first quickly assess the severity and scope. Small issues might be faster to hotfix than to roll back, which may have its own risks."
