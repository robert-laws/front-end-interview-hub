      Front-End Interview Hub is a focused learning site that turns 14 high-signal interview questions into self-contained, in-depth learning modules.
    </p>
    <h2>Why These 14 Topics?</h2>
    <p>
      These questions represent the core competencies that front-end teams evaluate in real interviews. They span CSS mastery, accessibility, debugging strategies, CMS experience, and professional practices. Instead of broad, shallow coverage, each module goes deep into one topic.
    </p>
